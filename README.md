# Roomiify - Spotify Room

Roomiify is a web app that turns your Spotify music taste into a personalized virtual room using your stats and listening habits, complete with themed visuals and a pet companion.  
Built with the **ASP.NET Core** framework, this project was developed as part of a university thesis at the University of Piraeus. The thesis paper and a demo video can be found on the following link.
